How to import source code?
1. For angular 6 files, you will need to import the dependencies using => npm install.
You will need to run "npm update" or "npm install" to get those dependencies. 
Internet connection is required and depending on your hardware, it might take several mins to import.
After importing, you can run "ng serve --port 4200" to start the app.
You can replace the port number and if you don't specify, the default port is 4200.


2. For Spring Framework, you need to have Spring plugins installed and then you can import the source code as maven. 
The IDE should recognize the source code.
